<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<br><br>

<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>  
 
<br><br>

<h1 id="structure">Structure & Concept</h1>
The application to be structured to provide:<br><br>
<ul>
    <li> an initial presentation of 'rules' and 'start' options to user;</li>
    <li>selection of 'rules' lanuches modal setting out how to play</li>
    <li>selection of 'start' launches selection of subject matter categories</li>
    <li>each category, on selection, launching a series of subject related multiple choice questions</li>
    <li>the user's score tallied in real-time as answers to each question are selected</li>
  </ul><br>

<br><br>

<h1 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h1>
Wireframes were made for each display size and are shown below, these were the basic layout that I envisaged before undertaking this project and what were originally completed to get to my MVP. The pages I made were designed for mobile first, then tablet and desktop last.
<br>
<h2 id="wf-index">Index Page:</h2>
<br>
The index page holds the main content of the site. You are greeted with a featured game reviews section and then a list of other reviews below that in a separate section.
<br>

<h2 id="wf-review-detail">Review Detail Page:</h2>
<br>
This page is the main part of the site for the user. The top section has the game name and an image of it. The main section below this is the review and the score of the game. On the right hand side of this there are several sections, for game information, developer and publisher information. At the bottom below these are user comments and user reviews.

<br>
<h2 id="wf-search">Search Page:</h2>
<br>
This page shows all the games, publishers, developers or genres that match the search criteria and would show as separate sections.

<br>
<h2 id="wf-form">Form Pages:</h2>
<br>
I decided I wwould want all my forms simply centered in the screen with no other distractions from the task in hand.

<h1 id="ai">AI Implementation</h1>
The Pubtastic Quizathon used the team's skills in combination with AI in a number of key areas:
<ul>
<li>Imagery - the images were developed using a Freepik AI image and graphics generation account, iterating designs and color schemes to achieve the desired result.</li>
<li>Code Assistance - AI was used in different instances to support learning in the application of code in all areas as appropriate - this included HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Iteration and defining clear concise prompts was critical for getting the correct assistance from AI</li>
<li>Debugging - AI was very useful in helping to identify the basis for areas where functionality was not as expected, and allowing different approaches or be used to eliminate those issues. It also served as a learning tool during that process when paricular code segments were not particularly clear.</li>
</ul>
AI is a fantastic tool but is not a replacement for a developer who does not understand the code that is generated. Duplicate segments of code had to be removed during iterations as well as moving inline CSS styles that it preferred to a separate CSS file.
